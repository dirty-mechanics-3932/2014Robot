2014 Robot - Project in Netbeans is now called Stitch 2014.
==================

2014-02-14
Worked with Charlie and Zack to get the robot program in line with the current test control system.  The basic controls (2 joysticks for drive system, compressor and arm) are all coded correctly.

The current robot project is now called "Stitch2014".  

Robot expects configuration:
- compressor on pressureSwitchChannel 1, relay channel 6
- left drive is jaguar on 1
- right drive is jaguar on 2
- arm drive is jaguar on 3

I verified that all the code that Danny committed is working.

A good deal of functinoality is being built into the SmartJoystick class.
