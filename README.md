The current robot project is now called "Stitch2014".  

Robot expects configuration:
- compressor on pressureSwitchChannel 1, relay channel 6
- left drive is jaguar on 1
- right drive is jaguar on 2
- arm drive is jaguar on 3

I verified that all the code that Danny committed is working.

A good deal of functinoality is being built into the SmartJoystick class.
